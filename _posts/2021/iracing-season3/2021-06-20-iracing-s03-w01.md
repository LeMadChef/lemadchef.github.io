## Disapointing start to the season

Spec Racer Ford is all new! MX-5 now has a sequential! Red Bull Ring! Sounds like a great week, right? Oh, wait. Chad is a slow learner and this week was a disaster. So much safety rating gone, now I'm in jeopardy of losing my A class license. Not that's a big deal because I'm racing Class D and Class C this season.

At least I got my particpation credit.

### Best Race Recap
* **Spec Racer Ford (Class D)**: [WeatherTech Raceway at Laguna Seca - Full Course](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&subsessionid=39305533). 16 laps. Qualified 5th, ranked 11th. What a disaster! I qualified pretty well and just wanted to get to the end of the race to pick up some SR. I didn't do well in practice, but I figured I'd be OK. LOL, I went off or spun so many times I literally was kicked out of the race. I lost 0.85 Safety Rating!  
**SRF Results**: Best lap: 1:36.881. Disqualified because of so many incidents. Strength of Field was 1352. I lost 55 iRating and gained 16 championship points.

Qualified 6th, ranked 1st. I had some decent battles, but kept falling back and collected a healthy number of incidents, mostly my fault. I lost 0.17 Safety Rating.
