This week was quiet. Only one series and that was Advanced MX-5. I took quite a beating on the first race and didn't do much better in the other races at this track and ended up with an iRating of 1304. To "console" myself I trolled the Rookie series (which was racing next week's Advanced MX-5 track) and gained a bit of iRating. It's not completely trolling as there are tons of folks racing Rookies, and I'm paired with people of relatively equal skill. I ended the week at 1489. 

* **Spec Racer Ford**: Mount Panorama. 10 laps. I do not have this track. No race.  
**SRF Results**: No best lap.  
* **Advanced MX-5 Cup**: 24 Hours of Le Mans. 25 minutes. This is the first time I raced this track and couldn't get the hang of it. First race there was a wreck, in the middle of the Mulsanne Straight far from any corner or chicane. The rest of the week was medicore.  
**MX-5 Results**: Best lap: 5:02.101. Best finsh was 6th place out of a field of 26. Strength of Field was 1386 and I gained 63 iRating.
* **VRS GT Sprint**: Nurburging Combined layout. 40 Minutes. I don't have either Nurburgring or Nordschleife (you need both to race) so I didn't race.  
**VRS Results**: No best lap.
* **IMSA**: Twin Ring Motegi - GP Layout. 45 Minutes. I do not have this track. No race.
**IMSA Results**: No best lap.
