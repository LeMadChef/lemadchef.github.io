## You gotta take the good with the bad.

I had an amazing race with MX-5 on Tuesday, see the previous post. What a rush! Probably my best race yet.

I spent Thursday (my other practice session) practicing at Sebring with the Lamborghini. I am bad at this track and it's an extremely challenging course. In my practice I'm 5+ seconds off pace and I'm considering not driving it at all in VRS this week. It's the final race with both the SRF and IMSA (same GT-3 car) and I'm good for participation credit, so maybe I'll punt and not drive it at all this season.

Saturday morning - it's my first race and I thought I would take a chance with Spec Racer Ford at Gilles Villeneuve. I'm 2 seconds off my ideal pace, and nearly 4 seconds off the fastest pace. It's ok, I'm consistent and I can get a little iRating and Safety Rating, so I entered with a little trepidation. This ended up being a great race, I qualified 2nd, and passed 1st place in the 2nd corner. I just took it easy and was quickly 10 seconds ahead. After that, I tried to keep it nice and tidy to maintain my advantaget the entire race, and only had one late braking incident missing turn 8 (costing me 2 seconds) and one "wall kiss" at turn 10. I led the entire race and finished first for a healthy gain in iRating and Safety Rating. This race also completed my season partipation credit and earned me FOUR WHOLE DOLLARS.

Coming off that good experience, I thought I'd give Sebring in VRS a try. Practice went well - I was off pace, but smooth and consistent. I joined the race as the lowest ranked driver and qualified nicely in 21st place. I figured I could pick up some safety points and maybe a little bit of iRating to boot. Well that was a good idea, I got a few good places early in the race and was in the top 20 and then made a stupid mistake in the hairpin, spinning and going to the back (resulting in a healthy 5x). No worries, I'll just hang in there and hopefully gain a few positions by the end. I'm still ranked last so maybe I can mainting some safety rating and loose a minimum amount of iRating. Well, a few corners later a clearly faster car completely putnted me LeMans pushing me off and, unfortunately, black-flagging me for mandatory repairs. **Sigh** well, what am I going to do? I pull into the pits and ... IT'S 22 MINUTES OF MANDATORY REPAIRS. Woof. Clearly I didn't end this race well - only finishing 10 laps (out of 20 that the leasder did) and losing a huge chunk of iRating. I didn't finsh last thankfully, but I didn't complete enough laps to get the credit. I don't think I'll make another attempt because A) I have two more races and I'll finish my mandatory 8 races, and B) The max credit is $10 and I'll get that with IMSA ($7) and MX-5 ($4) by week 12.

IMSA - to come!

### Results:
* **Spec Racer Ford**: [Circuit Gilles Villeneuve](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&subsessionid=37527836). 13 laps. Qualified 2nd, ranked 7th. I was in the 2nd split, but I was still well down in the ranking. I Had a good start that I capitalized on. Only 2 mistakes resulting in a 1x, and I led the race, so I had a healthy iRating and Safety Rating gain!
