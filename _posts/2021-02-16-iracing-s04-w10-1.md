## A great drive in Advanced MX-5!

Some races are bad, and some are good, but rarely do I have a good race and a bad race in the same race!
 
This week it’s Monza with the MX-5. I just raced that with the GT-3 last week so I remember the race well, plus I’m in a slower car so I have time to think, so I thought I’d give it a go - even if it’s my “practice night.”
 
I entered the race ranked 7th and thought I could place well in the top 10, and maybe pull off a top 5 (I’m getting better at longer races due to my consistency, not outright speed). I hit the barrier in my put lap in quali, putting me down at 8th on the grid. No worries, I have a leisurely 45 minutes so I’ll be fine.
 
First corner went well, and the top 10 didn’t pile up thankfully. The guy ahead of me was slow off the line and so I picked up a place. I picked up a few more places though the first lap or two, still taking it easy. 6th place! Wow I’m stoked! 

We got down to racing. Three of us were battling for 6th, 7th, and 8th and I was in front through Ascari. Easy out and WHAM! Guy behind me punts for no reason. I wasn’t turning in, gave him plenty of room. WHAM WHAM WHAM. No one uses brakes any more? What the heck? Somehow I survived with only a +4 even though I should have been dead from getting hit by every car. 
 
Well, after an eternity of being a Miata shaped pinball I ended up in the grass facing the wrong way. I let the remaining cars go by and got back on track. The iRacing gods smiled and I didn’t have any significant damage to front end (aero) or steering / alignment. I was in 22nd place, but I could still salvage the race. Maybe a top 15? And minimize my iRating hit.
 
I got back on the gas and started lapping. I gained quite a few places within the first few laps and started jumping up. 17th, 15th, 11th! Hmm, I’m catching up to the next 3 cars but I need to pit for fuel, and there’s still 20 minutes so I can’t go with an aggressive fuel strategy. Better just fill up.
 
After what seemed like an eternity fueling, I rejoined in 17th, but due to fuel windows that doesn’t mean anything. Hopefully I can regain my positions and get 10th. Another few laps go by and I’m solidly in the top 10! I spent the rest off the race battling 3-4 cars with many “lead” changes in the group. We were all angling for 7th and we all wanted it. We were all racing really clean, only a few bumps which didn’t result in any penalties. I got ahead with about 5 laps to go and was pulling by away, then outbreaked myself in the first corner! Argh! I missed it, got flagged and so I let the other two guys go. Oh well, 9th is way better than 22nd! 
 
The guy in 8th was ragged so I passed him again, but the guy in 7th - he was ranked higher than me, and was driving well. I could tell he was a little slower but it wasn’t enough to send it and he was racing extremely well. We hung together until the last lap, but he made a small mistake and I capitalized on it. I could tell his tires were going off so I gave him a wide berth in a few corners and found one where I was able to cleanly slip inside him.
 
7th place has never felt so good! I need to record it and post that to YouTube!
