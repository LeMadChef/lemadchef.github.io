Well, it's about time I blog. I've been meaning to do this for a while and have been back-and forth about 'DIY' versus something already in place like WordPress or Squarespace. I really wanted to do this myself, but I didn't want to take a lot of time and effort to just get things going. Baby steps.

I finally settled on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because that sounded like the right balance of easy and still good control. I'm familiar with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and like the back-to-basics idea of mostly controlling my HTML. I'm no designer, but that's really not the point of a blog is it?

It ended up being pretty simple after a few slightly confusing steps. Getting "hello.html" in GitHub Pages was dead simple, but installing and Jekyll and understanding the layout took me a bit. Fortunately it's just a few tweaks to the "new site" funcationality, and a few local edit/run/debug loops locally to make sure everything is working. Next step is topush to your GitHub pages repo (creating a new site helpfully automatically adds a .gitignore) and you are up and running!
