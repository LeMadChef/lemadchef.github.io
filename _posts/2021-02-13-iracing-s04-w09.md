# Finally placed well in VRS!

I have been considering abandoning VRS Sprint as it's been a challenging season. First, it's challenging because I'm in a new, much faster car, and second VRS is tightly contested - there are a lot of folks racing so the "experience spread" is very close in each race. Last week was terrible, I thought I was prepared, but did horribly. This week I thought I would just get the race out of the way "first thing" and enjoy the other races.

I practiced a bit (not too much) and joined the race. I noticed I was the highest ranked in the session. "Hoo boy" I thought. "Another iRating slaughter". Well, I figured I would just take it easy in qualifying and set a race pace lap. I qualified 17th. I felt ok though and I know that at my level it's "to finish first, first you must finish" - just keep it nice and tidy (on track) and dont get distracted and don't make any mistakes and you are home free. Well, I managed to do just that! I only had one minor off (resulting in a 1x, not a spin), and a few cut track incidents, as well as a few missed braking opportunities. I was able to recover from each of them and push on.

* **VRS GT Sprint**: Oulton Park Circuit - International. 40 minutes. Qualified 17th, ranked 1st. Good race for me overall. I managed to keep it on track except for one stupid off and I gained both Safety Rating and iRating. A very satisfying conclusion to the race!
