This season I decided to race in [IMSA SportsCar Championship](https://www.iracing.com/series/imsa-sportscar-championship/) in the GT3 class using the new [Lamborghini Hurac√°n GT3 EVO](https://www.iracing.com/cars/lamborghini-huracan-gt3-evo/). I was able to pick up enough tracks to race in [VRS GT Sprint](https://www.iracing.com/series/vrs-gt-sprint-series/) as well as I can drive the same GT-3 class car in both. I have been racing [SCCA Spec Racer Ford](https://www.iracing.com/cars/scca-spec-racer/) for 2 seasons and have done pretty well (last season I placed 18th in my division) and earned a B class licens from doing [Advanced MX-5 Cup](https://www.iracing.com/cars/new-maxda-mx-5/). I was able to pick up enough tracks to get full participation credit in SRF, Advanced MX-5, VRS Sprint, and IMSA. That's a full plate of races most weeks, but I'm going to focus on IMSA and Advanced MX-5 Cup becuase the max you can earn is [$10 per season](https://www.iracing.com/race-participation-credit-program/). D (SRF) & C (Advanced MX-5) class gives $4 and B (IMSA/VRS Sprint) class gives $7.

Well, I got all my races in this week. It's a mixed bag and I realize now that 4 different cars on 4 differerent tracks is a bad idea. Here's my results:
* **Spec Racer Ford**: Oran Park Raceway - Grand Prix layout. 20 laps (Tuesday night). I've driven this course a bit in the MX-5, and I understand the layout. It's a tight track. I jumped the start which means a 30 second pit penalty. That messed me up mentally for the race and I didn't do well. I managed to gain Safety Rating (SR) but lost iRating against the strong field. I still enjoy SRF, but I'll focus on MX-5.  
**SRF Results**: Best lap: 2:55.645. I finished 12th out of a field of 15 (down 1 lap). Strength of Field was 2123 and I lost 29 iRating for a final iRating of 1461.  
* **IMSA**: Watkins Glen International - Boot layout. 45 Minutes (Sunday Morning). I was pretty worried about this as I've heard ... bad things ... about LMP drivers. It turns out everyone was really well behaved and I had an absolute blast! I love IMSA!  
**IMSA Results**: Best lap: 1:49.205. I finished 8th out of 12 in my class (GTD) and 30th out of 40 overall. Strength of Field was 1828 and I lost 22 iRating for a final iRating of 1439.
* **Advanced MX-5 Cup**: Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps - Grand Prix Pits layout. 45 minutes (Sunday Morning). They call this "Advanced" to distinguish it from the Rookie series, but there's still a lot of rookie mistakes. I got punted early in the first lap and had serious body damage. This is bad in the MX-5 on a long track like Spa so I did poorly.  
**MX-5 Results**: Best lap: 2:55.421. I finished 21st (down 3 laps) out of a field of 24. Strength of Field was 1455 and lost 70 iRating for a final iRating of 1369.
* **VRS GT Sprint**: Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps - Grand Prix Pits layout. 40 Minutes (Sunday afternoon). This was a lot more challenging than IMSA to be honest and I was lucky to get Spa for two different series (after Spa for the last race in SRF last season). The drivers here are much faster than the GT-3 folks in IMSA for the Strength of Field I'm in. I don't know if that's due to the single-make nature of the class or just that it attracts more focused drivers. I enjoyed the racing but prefer IMSA for engagement.  
**VRS Results**: Best lap: 2:21.493. I finished 18th out of a field of 29. Strength of Field was 1378 and lost 20 iRating for a final iRating of 1349.

Here's hoping I do better next week!
