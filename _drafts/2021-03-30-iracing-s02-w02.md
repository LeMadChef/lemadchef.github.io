## A decent week

I'm racing 2 of each race per week, and picking the best one. I'm switching between the Porsche and the McLaren in GT-4, but I'm considering going "all in" on the McLaren, I'm really warming up to that car.

### Race Detail
* **Spec Racer Ford**: [Watkins Glen International - Boot](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&subsessionid=38070488). 11 laps. Qualified 7th, ranked 11th. I'm still struggling with SRF after racing nearly a year. It still likes to oversteer and that has caused me several places. I feel pretty good though, just need to get smoother and be very gentle on the brakes. This is a momentum car anyway. The biggest thing is to keep it on the track and not spin so I don't have any incidents.  
**SRF Results**: Best lap: 2:13.190. Finshed 9th place out of a field of 19. Strength of Field was 1512 and I gained 14 iRating.  
* **Advanced MX-5 Cup**: [Course - Layout](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/EventResult.do?&subsessionid=). 25 minutes. Qualified Nth, ranked Mth. Experience.  
**MX-5 Results**: Best lap: m:ss.hhh. Finshed Xth place out of a field of YY. Strength of Field was NNNN and I gained MM iRating.
